Flight.h

Flight  - Essentially, flight is the basic idea of a plane going to an airport
from an airport, at a certain time, at a certain gate. This object will be made
by the scheduler, and used as a basic unit for things like recalculation. It
will be given to an airport, so as to allow for communication and consistency.

Who makes this object? Values are read in from the time table into Airline,
which puts them in a vector.

Is it a time observer? No

Whatâ€™s its goal? Hold the base value of one flight, meaning one trip in between
two airports, and the information such as ticket cost associated with it.
